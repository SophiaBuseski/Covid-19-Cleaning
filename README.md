# US-Household-Income
US Household Income SQL Analysis Project

## Project Overview 
In this project, I focused on the meticulous cleaning, preparation, and analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL.

## Objective 
The primary goal was to transform raw data into a reliable dataset for further analysis, ensuring accuracy and consistency. This involved various SQL techniques to clean and process data, enabling meaningful insights into COVID-19 trends.


## Data 
- Excel Dataset 1 [See It!](https://github.com/SophiaBuseski/Covid-19-Cleaning/blob/main/CovidDeaths.xlsx)

- Excel Dataset 2 [See It!](https://github.com/SophiaBuseski/Covid-19-Cleaning/blob/main/CovidVacs.xlsx)

- Data Cleaning and Exploration Code [See It!](https://github.com/SophiaBuseski/Covid-19-Cleaning/blob/main/Covid%20Portfolio%20Project%201.sql)

- Tableau Dashboard [See It](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidDashboard_17150362368900/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Key Achievements:

### 1. Data Acquisition and Initial Exploration:

  - Imported COVID-19 datasets from trusted sources such as Johns Hopkins University.
    
  - Performed initial exploration to understand the structure and quality of the data, filtering out irrelevant records for focused analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:

  - Utilized SQL to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats.

  - Implemented filtering criteria to exclude records with null continent values, ensuring completeness in regional analysis.

### 3. Complex Query Execution for Data Insights:

  - Data Selection: Selected specific columns (e.g., location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, population) to focus on key metrics.
    
  - Case vs. Death Analysis: Calculated the likelihood of death given a COVID-19 infection by computing death percentages.
    
  - Population Infection Rates: Analyzed the percentage of the population infected by COVID-19 across different locations.
    
  - High-Infection and High-Death Regions: Identified countries with the highest infection rates and death counts relative to their populations.
    
  - Continental and Global Summaries: Aggregated data to provide continent-specific and global overviews of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and death percentages.

### 4. Advanced SQL Techniques:

  - Window Functions: Used window functions to calculate rolling sums of vaccinations, enabling the tracking of vaccination progress over time.
    
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Employed CTEs for modular and readable queries, simplifying complex calculations and intermediate results.
    
  - Temporary Tables: Created temporary tables for intermediate data storage, facilitating efficient analysis and reducing query complexity.
    
  - Views: Established views for persistent and reusable query results, supporting easy data access for visualization and reporting tools.

### 5. Performance Optimization:

  - Indexed key columns to enhance query performance and speed up data retrieval processes.
    
  - Optimized queries for handling large datasets, ensuring efficient processing and accurate results.

### 6. Data Transformation and Reporting:

  - Created comprehensive reports and visualizations to communicate key findings, leveraging SQL to prepare data for tools such as Tableau or Power BI.
    
  - Highlighted critical insights, such as infection and death trends, vaccination rates, and regional disparities, providing a solid foundation for data-driven decision-making.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated:

  - Proficiency in SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and complex querying.
    
  - Advanced use of SQL functions, CTEs, window functions, and temporary tables.
    
  - Data visualization and reporting through SQL-based data preparation.
    
  - Strong analytical skills in deriving meaningful insights from cleaned datasets.
    
This project showcased my ability to manage and clean large datasets using SQL, ensuring data quality and reliability. The cleaned and processed data provided valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting effective analysis and decision-making.
